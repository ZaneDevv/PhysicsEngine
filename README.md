# PhysicsEngine

Physics engines are fundamental when it comes to game development: whithout physics, there is not a game.<br>
I have always found physics rinventing and intriguing, motivating me to learn a bit about this combine it with all my knowledge of computer science.<br>
Since I am not familiar with `OpenGL` or `Vulkan`, I decided to make it using C# and a plugin called `MonoGame`, which extends the language with simple functions to draw polygons in the screen in a quite simple way.<br>
